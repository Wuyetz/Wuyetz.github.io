World Cup 2018 simulator 

I made this in javascript (later adding some jquery), html and css. It produces very realistic match results by taking into account 
expected number of goals in a football match and team powers, sorts tables and simulates progression through whole tournament by 
matching correct team pairs, all by fifa rules. In the end it gives us a list of highscoring games and offers us to go from beggining.
Check notes in javascript file to have a better feeling of how I made it work and see it in action at : https://wuyetz.github.io/ .
