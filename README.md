World Cup 2018 simulator 

I made this in javascript with jquery, html and css. 

It produces very realistic match results by taking into account expected number of goals in a football match and team powers, sorts tables and simulates progression through whole tournament by matching correct team pairs, all by fifa rules. In the end it gives us a list of highscoring games and offers us to go from beggining.

Check notes in javascript file to have a better feeling of how I made it work and see it in action at : https://wuyetz.github.io/ .

Download it as zip file, extract it to folder of your choosing and click "open with.." on "index" file and choose your internet browser to open it (I tested it on Google Chrome Version 67.0.3396.99 (Official Build) (64-bit))
